# UPL Schema

## What does UPL mean?
UPL stands for Universal Parsing Language. It's an ambitious name, and the most probable is that never will be true, but I think that is the most precise one for what I am aiming with this project. 

The idea is to have an schema definition that defines the parsing of a website or a group of them and is agnostic of the language implementation. The language should be clear enough to have only one interpretation.

Mantras:
* The UPL schemas only have one interpretation, given one schema and one webpage, there is only one possible result.

## What is this project about?
This project is designed to define the schema used in UPL and documentation about it.
